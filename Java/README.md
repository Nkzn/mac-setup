# Java

## Installation
First you should check if Java is already installed

    $ java -version

If you see an output like below then Java is already installed on your machine so skip to _Add Java to PATH_.

    java version "1.8.0_45"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_45-b14)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.45-b02, mixed mode)

If you don't see the output like above then you need to install Java on your system. Please download the macOS version from the [Oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

Check if Java is correctly installed by running the `java -version` command again.

## Add Java to PATH

Add `JAVA_HOME` to your environment variables by adding the line below to your `env.sh` (see [iTerm2](/mac-setup/iTerm/README.html) section if you don't have a `env.sh` file).

    export JAVA_HOME="`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`"

Are you Java9 user? Use below instead of above.

    export JAVA_HOME="`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 9`"

You should have Java working now. Two popular IDE alternatives for writing Java are [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
